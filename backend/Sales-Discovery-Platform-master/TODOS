1. In csv upload of users, the company filed in TemporaryUserProfile is set automatically from the company field in
    the UserProfile of the currently logged in user.

    If the user has not updated his company filed in user profile, this can break

    TODO : Need to Permission class describing whether the user has verified and filled all necessary details in the user profile, and adding this permission to csv_userprofiles_upload API


2.  TODO:  CsvUserProfileUploadView  uses sendmail fuction in the same thread. This should be made asynchronous, otherwise the request will timeout
           We can use django-mailer with some other job scheduler like Celery.
